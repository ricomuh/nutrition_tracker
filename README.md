   - Go to Settings ‚Üí AI Configuration
   - Select your preferred AI provider (Gemini or OpenAI)
   - Enter your API key

4. **Fine-tune your goals**:
   - Adjust calorie deficit/surplus if needed
   - Set custom thresholds based on your specific goals

## How to Use

### Adding Food Entries

1. **Tap the + button** on the home screen
2. **Select meal type** (auto-selected based on current time)
3. **Take a photo** or select from gallery
4. **Optional**: Add text description of food items
5. **Analyze** - AI will process the image and return nutrition data
6. **Review and edit** if needed
7. **Save** the entry

### Viewing Daily Progress

- **Daily Summary Card**: Shows total calories, macros, and progress
- **Meal Sections**: Organized by meal type with individual entries
- **Goal Warnings**: Alerts if you exceed cutting targets
- **Date Navigation**: Browse previous days or plan ahead

### Managing Settings

- **AI Configuration**: Switch providers or update API keys
- **User Profile**: Modify physical stats and activity levels
- **Goal Adjustment**: Change calorie targets and fitness goals
- **Data Management**: Reset all data if needed

## Technical Details

### Architecture

- **State Management**: Provider pattern for reactive UI updates
- **Local Storage**: SQLite for nutrition entries, SharedPreferences for settings
- **Image Handling**: Camera and gallery integration with compression
- **AI Integration**: Modular service supporting both Gemini and OpenAI APIs

### Data Models

- **UserProfile**: Physical stats, activity level, goals
- **NutritionEntry**: Food items, macros, meal type, timestamps
- **FoodItem**: Individual food components with quantities
- **AppSettings**: AI provider, API keys, app preferences

### AI Prompt Engineering

The app uses carefully crafted prompts to ensure consistent JSON responses from both AI providers, including:

- Structured nutrition analysis requests
- Revision and recalculation commands
- Encouraging, positive feedback generation

## Privacy & Security

- **Local Data**: All nutrition data is stored locally on your device
- **API Keys**: Stored securely on device, never transmitted to third parties
- **Images**: Processed by AI services but not permanently stored by providers
- **No Cloud Sync**: Complete data privacy with local-only storage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **AI Analysis Fails**

   - Verify API key is correct and active
   - Check internet connection
   - Ensure image is clear and shows food items

2. **Permissions Denied**

   - Grant camera and storage permissions in device settings
   - Restart app after permission changes

3. **Build Errors**
   - Run `flutter clean` then `flutter pub get`
   - Regenerate code with `flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
